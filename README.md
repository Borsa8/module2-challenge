# Module2 Challenge

## Description

#### Acceptance Criteria

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you,

* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section,

* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications,

* When presented with your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others,

* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application,

* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.
